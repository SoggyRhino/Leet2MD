> Copy a leetcode problem as markdown, (for obsidain notes)

## Usage 
Copy the entire bookmark.js into the link portion of a book mark. Click the bookmark when you are not leetcode.com, the markdown will be copied to the clipboard

## Misc
- Some problems have special formatting so it might not work. I will fix the script as I come across new problems that dont work.
- My obsidian strategy is different since intead of using tags I link to a file
  - This is so that I can go to a "tag" and see all the back links as well as add additonal information about the tag
- Images are not downloaded but emebed by external link
  - `![](https://linktotheimage.com/image.png)`
- Try to use the bookmark on a site that is not leetcode.com :)
